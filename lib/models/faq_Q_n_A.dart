  "We suggest all customers make an informed decision before making a purchase of our cannabis seeds offerings in the vault or auction house. We do not offer refunds on these items unless something drastic has happened.\nPlease ensure that you have taken the financial due diligence before committing to a purchase. All of our offerings are in flash-sale or auction format and very limited in quantities. These are campaign driven drops and chances of replicating the same campaign in the short period of time is slim and you would have only stopped somebody else making the purchase.\n\nAll Kannapy Merchandise is definitely an exception to the above refund policy. We accept all returns on Kannapy Merchandise as long as they returned  to us unused and unopened.",
